# UKAD-test
The project is a hyperlinked website that contains two pages: 
Home and Products, which show how to connect the API by using the fetch() method of an object, 
and creating cards with product name, price, image, and description based on it. The work also uses grids and the creation of a slider with a card-product.
The project was created solely for educational purposes.
In order to create such a project, we need a basic knowledge of HTML markup and CSS styles, in order to make the project look presentable. 
To add animated elements or elements such as buttons or sliders, we need to plug in some JS to liven up the project.
